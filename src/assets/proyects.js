    about: `The main reason of this project was to reinforce my vanilla habilities, before jumping entirely into React and its wonderful enviroment.

    I tried to limit myself to just use the old basics HTML, CSS and JavaScript and added some challenges like use the Google Maps API, make a multipage website and use tools like PostCSS to add browser compatibility and SASS to develop faster.

    I used the BEM methodology in case my future me wants to reimplement the project in React (Not a fan of rewriting CSS).

    Last thing and most important since I'm not a designer, this design was inspired by the TAKT Studio website.`,

    about: `This was my second block Ac√°mica project, they gave us a checklist and like any real project, you would have to send it back acording to that checklist.

    The three most important topics that I learned were:
      - The advantages of using a functional CSS framework, like the easiness of adding new features and modificate existence ones.
      - How to handle multiple request at the same time, by using the Fetch API and learning about Promises.
      - How the redux cycle works, and how middlewares allow us to make that cycle asynchronous.`,
